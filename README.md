# 📐 3D Reconstruction of Point Cloud to Mechanical Drawing STEP
*A semester-long undergraduate research immersion program bridging 3D scanning and CAD integration*

## 🎯 Project Description
This project aims to develop a computational pipeline that converts raw 3D point cloud data (typically from laser scanners or photogrammetry) into industry-standard STEP files (ISO 10303) for mechanical CAD applications. Students will gain hands-on experience in:
- Point cloud processing and surface reconstruction
- CAD geometry representation principles
- ISO 10303 STEP file structure
- Algorithm development for shape conversion
- Industrial reverse engineering workflows

Key technical challenges: 
- 🔄 Converting unstructured point data to parametric geometry
- ⚙️ Maintaining manufacturing constraints in automated reconstruction
- 🔍 Precision validation against original scans
